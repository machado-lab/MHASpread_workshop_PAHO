## :mortar_board: About this workshop

> In this four-day workshop, we provide a gentle introduction to a range of mathematical models used to simulate the spread and control of livestock diseases. You learn how such models can be used to make informed decisions **before**, **during**, and **after** an animal health emergency.
<br /> We will focus on the application of such epidemiological models while demonstrating their use with real data while simulating FMD outbreaks. The real data we will need includes


## :bomb: Aims of the workshop
* Learn how to use the MHASpread v.0.1.0 package, introduction, and control of FMD.
    - [ ]  Overview of the model outputs and their interpretation.
    - [ ]  MHASpread to simulate FMD countermeasure actions (depopulation, vaccination, and traceability). 
    - [ ]  To be exposed to additional transmission models.

## :floppy_disk: Data and files required 

We will focus on the application of such epidemiological models while demonstrating their use with real data while simulating FMD outbreaks. The real data we will need includes:

1. List of farms with unique identification, geolocation (lat and long), and a number of animals per premise by species (e.i., farm A has 10 cattle, 100 swine, and 3 goats).
2. Number of animals born alive and mortality per premise and species.
3. Between-farm and slaughterhouse movement data, which include:    
   * Unique identification at origin and at the destination.
   * Date of the movement.
   * The number of animals transported for each species.
