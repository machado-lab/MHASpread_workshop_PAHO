# Dissemination and control scenarios


### 1 Initial conditions (detection in 10 days) (bovine):

Infection starts at farm node=1804 (farm population is 100 animals). FMD is first detected 10 days post-infection (infection started with one infected animal).

Control actions scenarios:
1. Control zones (infected= 3 km, buffer = 7 km, and surveillance = 15 km).
2. Depopulation of infected farms (10 days since FMD was detected, 4 farms per day)
3. Movement restrictions (30 days of standstill, 1-step contact tracing of farms with movements coming from infected farms)
3. Vaccination (20 days since FMD was detected, maximum of 100 farms per day) with seroprotection of 90%.

Conclusion (group discussion): What would you do differently and why, please propose a solution and run the updated control scenario(s).



### 2 Initial conditions:(detection in 20 days) (swine):

Infection starts at farm node=66 (farm population is 10 animals). FMD is first detected 20 days post-infection (infection started with one infected animal).

Control actions scenarios:
1) Control zones (infected= 3 km, buffer = 7 km, and surveillance = 15 km) 
2) Depopulation of infected farms (20 days since FMD was detected, 4 farms per day)
3) Movement restrictions (30 days of standstill)
4) Vaccination (20 days since FMD was detected, maximum of 200 farms per day) 

Conclusion (group discussion): What would you do differently and why, please propose a solution and run the updated control scenario(s).

### 3 Initial conditions:(detection in 20 days) (bovine and small ruminants):

Infection starts at farm node=137753 (farm population is 523 bovine and 10 small ruminants). FMD is first detected 20 days post-infection (infection started with 10 infected bovines and 10 infected small ruminants).

Control actions scenarios:
1) Control zones (infected= 3 km, buffer = 7 km, and surveillance = 15 km).
2) Depopulation of the infected farm (10 days since FMD was detected, 4 farms per day).
3) Movement restrictions (30 days standstill).
4) Vaccination (20 days since FMD was detected, maximum of 200 farms per day) with maximum seroprotection of 90%.


Conclusion (group discussion): What would you do differently and why, please propose a solution and run the updated control scenario(s).

### 4 Initial conditions:(detection in 20 days) (bovine- Livramento):

Infection starts at farm node=196734 (farm population is 44 bovine). FMD is first detected 20 days post-infection (infection started with 40 infected animals).

Control actions scenarios:
1) Control zones (infected= 3 km, buffer = 7 km, and surveillance = 15 km).
2) Depopulation of the infected farm (10 days since FMD was detected, 4 farms per day)
3) Movement restrictions (30 days standstill)
4) Vaccination (20 days since FMD was detected, maximum of 100 farms per day, vaccinating bovine and/or small ruminants) with maximum seroprotection of 90%.


Conclusion (group discussion): What would you do differently and why, please propose a solution and run the updated control scenario(s).


### 5 Initial conditions:(detection in 20 days) (bovine, swine, and small ruminants):

Infection starts at farm node=286 (farm population is 1 bovine, 13 swine, and 1 small ruminants). FMD is first detected 20 days post-infection (infection started with 10 infected animals).

Control actions scenarios:
1) Control zones (infected= 3 km, buffer = 7 km, and surveillance = 15 km).
2) Depopulation of the infected farm (10 days since FMD was detected, 4 farms per day)
3) Movement restrictions (30 days standstill)
4) Vaccination (20 days since FMD was detected, maximum of 100 farms per day, vaccinating bovine and/or small ruminants) with maximum seroprotection of 90%.
